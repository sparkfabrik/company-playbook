## Choosing a VPN Client

The company VPN uses OpenVPN, which is compatible with various open-source VPN clients. Below are recommended clients for MacOS:

- **Tunnelblick**: A free, open-source VPN client designed for use with OpenVPN. Download it from [Tunnelblick's official website](https://tunnelblick.net/).
