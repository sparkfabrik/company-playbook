This is a checklist and flight plan for new employees onboarding.

The document provides both _procedural_ tasks (such as opening accounts) and a depiction of the processes and assets that can help the decision-making phase of onboarding: assigning the employee to a team, mentoring them, setting goals, and evaluating results.

## Requirements

The following steps give access to all confidential information in the company, so before proceeding, check that:

1. The person hiring legally started (from the present day)

    **OR**

2. There is a _non-disclosure agreement_ running between the parties

## Pre-flight checks

HR must check the following list 14 days before the employee joins the company:

* If a laptop is already available or it must be ordered anew
* The employee needs a display, mouse, keyboard, and a USB hub to complete their home office
* All the employment documents are available to be signed by the employee
* The employee will be available to reach the office on the first day or not
* The team is prepared to welcome the employee and to perform the technical onboarding

## Devices, tools, and other items

* A laptop PC must be ordered **in advance** so that it will be available on the first day of work
* A proper power cord and optionally a compatible power supply (depending on the power grid voltage) must be bought in advance in case of foreign employees
* The display, mouse, and keyboard - if required - will be shipped directly to the employee during the first month of employment
* The office keys must be provided at the end of the probation to resident employees that must have autonomous access to the office
* The Welcome Kit must be available by the first day either shipped with the laptop or hand-delivered


## Things to do on the first day

### Creation of accounts

An HR representative will perform the following actions:

* Open the `@sparkfabrik.com` account for the new employee
* Add the newly created account to `staff@sparkfabrik.com` group
* Add the newly created account to all relevant `*-team@sparkfabrik.com` project/team mail groups
* Add the account to Slack and give a quick overview of the main channels
* Open the Gitlab account and add it to the `SparkFabrik` group, plus all relevant projects if necessary
* Add the GitHub account of the employee (or open it if not available) to the SparkFabrik organization
* Open the Float account and make sure it can access all relevant projects
* Invite the employee to PeopleForce, give a quick overview of the important sections, and make sure they review their profile information
* Invite the employee to Dipendenti in Cloud and give a quick overview of the important sections
* Make sure the employee can access all relevant calendars

### General setup

The employee must, with the help of an HR representative:

* Duly sign in and check their ability to access every service
* If they are a developer, log into GCP using [this procedure](/guides/local-development-environment-configuration#log-into-gcloud)
* Activate two-factor authentication on Gitlab
* Generate an SSH key and add it among the available keys for their Gitlab account
* Set their profile pictures (starting with Gravatar and checking on Gitlab, Slack, Toggl, etc) with an appropriate close-up
* Set their e-mail signature in [the official format](#standard-mail-signature-format) (respect bolds)
* Set the [SparkFabrik branded LinkedIn banner](#branded-linkedin-banner) on the Linkedin profile

### Company overview

Before ending the first onboarding phase, HR must:

* Introduce the new colleague to everyone on Slack `#general` channel
* Give a quick overview of the tools we use and clarify when to use what
* Show the company structure (functions and teams), cross-team interactions, and key contacts
* Smoke test the local development environment (also test XCode on Mac, if it applies)
* Introduces the new employee to their team

### Team and project onboarding

During this final phase, the team welcomes the new colleague and assigns them a buddy, who will make sure at least the following is done:

* The colleague meet each teammate and understood each one's role
* The colleague gets an overview of:
  * the team's project(s), customer(s), and touchpoints
  * which tools and practices are in place for the project(s)
  * the team's organization (boards, events, cadences, communication channels, etc)
* A full test of the local development environment is performed with the buddy
* The project is built locally and understood in its broad lines

The Team Leader will also make sure that:

* A call with the customer is planned to introduce the new colleague
* The colleague can:
  * See all relevant projects on Toggl and Float (if it applies)
  * Access all relevant projects on Gitlab, GitHub, or any other platform that may be relevant
  * Access all relevant slack channels (or other communication platforms) pertaining to relevant projects
  * Receive emails via relevant `-team@sparkfabrik.com` groups
* The colleague understands how to track time on team's project(s)

## Things to do within the first week

* The buddy [assesses the core skills with the colleague](/procedures/assessing-core-skills) and a [training plan is laid out](/procedures/assessing-core-skills#plan-the-training-on-core-skills) on the topics that need upskilling
* HR and the employee will schedule a 30 mins self-introduction to the whole company
* HR will schedule a one-on-one meeting with the employee at the end of the second week, to check in on the [onboarding goals](/guides/an-effective-onboarding-structure)
* The Team Leader will schedule a one-on-one meeting with the employee at the end of the first month, to exchange feedback and set the goals for the next couple months
* Marketing will contact the employee to choose a face wall shot (this can be used as a profile picture as well)

## Things to do one month after the onboarding

* HR will survey the employee and the Team Leader to collect feedback about the overall onboarding process, collect feedback, and address possible issues
* If necessary, HR will arrange a meeting between the management and the employee to share general evaluations and conclude the onboarding phase
* Marketing will publish a welcome message on our socials

## Things to do two months after the onboarding

* HR will arrange a meeting between the team leader and the employee to share feedback about the first two months in SparkFabrik

### Branded LinkedIn banner

We ask every employee who joins SparkFabrik and who has a LinkedIn account to immediately add an Experience record, connected to SparkFabrik's company profile with the correct role and starting date.

In addition, we ask them to set the [branded SparkFabrik's banner](/downloads/spark_linkedin_cover.png) as a background photo of their profile and (not mandatory but welcome) to use the facewall shot as the LinkedIn and sparkfabrik.com email profile picture.
