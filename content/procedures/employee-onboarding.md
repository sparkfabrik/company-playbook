This is a checklist and flight-plan for new employees onboarding.

The document provides both _procedural_ tasks (such as opening accounts) and a depiction of the processes and assets that can help the decision-making phase of an onboarding: assigning the employee to a team, mentoring them, setting goals and evaluate results.

## Requirements

The following steps give access to all confidential information in the company, so before proceeding, check that:

1. The person hiring legally started (from the present day) **OR**
2. There is a _non disclosure agreement_ running between the parties

## Devices, tools and objects

* A laptop PC must be ordered **in advance** so that it will be available on the first day of work
* For foreigners employees a proper power cord and optionally a compatible power supply (depending on the power grid voltage) must be bought in advance
* For resident employees, coming to the office on a daily basis, the office keys must be provided ideally from the first day
* Named business cards will usually be ordered after the end of the contractual trial period
* We usually provide a branded backpack with the laptop and branded stickers for the screen lid

## Pre-flight checks

An HR or Admin representative will perform the following actions:

* Open a `@sparkfabrik.com` account
* Add the newly created account to `staff@sparkfabrik.com` group
* Add the newly created account to all relevant `*-team@sparkfabrik.com` project/team mail groups
* Add the account to Slack and _invite_ it on `#general`, `#tech` and `#tech-support` as well as on all channels related to relevant projects
* Open the Gitlab account and add it to all relevant projects
* Log into GCP using [this procedure](/guides/local-development-environment-configuration#log-into-gcloud)
* Open the Toggl account and make sure it can access all relevant projects
* Invite the employee to PeopleForce and ask them to review their profile information
* Invite the employee to Dipendenti in Cloud and explain them the related policies
* Add the GitHub account of the employee (or open it if not available) to SparkFabrik organization and relevant projects
* Add the account to company's OpenVPN firewall (for external access)

## Things to do on the first day

### For the company

* HR must introduce the new employee to the resident team and, on slack `#general` channel, to the remote colleagues

  * Google Drive folder structure and usage
  * Google Calender configuration and conventions
  * How and whom to ask for help

  * Relevant starting training resources (accounts on _drupalize.me_ or _Udemy_, books or playbook pages)
  * How to contribute to the projects (branching model, peer review, etc)
  * Required tools, procedures and practices one need to know from the very beginning
* Tech and/or buddy must explain our key internal projects and self-made tools (sparkdrupal, sparkangular, sparkboard, firestarter, etc) to the employee

### For the employee

What follows will be performed with the help of your buddy, if needed

* Access all the services and check you can interact with them
* Activate two-factor auth on Gitlab
* Add SSH keys on Gitlab so you can clone the repositories
* Set your profile pictures (starting with Gravatar and checking on Gitlab, Slack, Toggl, etc) with an appropriate/decent close-up (or use the [facewall shot](#facewall-shot))
* Set your e-mail signature in [the format](#Standard-mail-signature-format) below (respect bolds)
* Set the [SparkFabrik branded LinkedIn banner](#LinkedIn-brand-guidelines) on the Linkedin profile

## Things to do within the first week

* HR will schedule a call with the employee and their buddy to clarify [onboarding goals](/guides/an-effective-onboarding-structure) and schedule the checkpoints
* HR will schedule a quick call to introduce the company management to the employee, and viceversa
* HR and the employee will schedule a brief talk where the employee will self-introduce to the company
* <a name="facewall-shot"></a>Marketing will contact the employee to choose a facewall shot (this can be used as profile picture as well)

## Things to do one month after the onboarding

* HR will survey the employee to collect feedback about the onboarding process
* If necessary, HR will arrange a meeting between the management and the employee to share general evaluations and conclude the onboarding phase

## Standard formats and snippets

### Standard mail signature format

> **SPARKFABRIK**
>
> **Name Surname**  
> Role or function
>
> +XX YYY ZZ.ZZ.ZZZ
> https://www.sparkfabrik.com

Role or function can be:

* Software Developer
* Lead developer
* C-Level or other management / board function

When in doubt, ask your HR representative.

### Branded LinkedIn banner

We ask every employee who joins SparkFabrik and who has a LinkedIn account to immediately add an Experience record, connected to SparkFabrik's company profile with the correct role and starting date.

In addition, we ask them to set the [branded SparkFabrik's banner](/downloads/spark_linkedin_cover.png) as background photo of their profile and (not mandatory but really welcomed) to use the facewall shot as LinkedIn and sparkfabrik.com email profile picture.
