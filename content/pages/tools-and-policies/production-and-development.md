    @todo create detailed chapters on
    - FOSS Tools used for our work with
      - a brief on what it is and why/for what we use it (maybe a one-liner like "Drupal is an open source CMS and web framework. We use it as the basis for 99% of our products."). It's important that we explain even to newcomers what is the purpose of the tool in relation to the whole schema and what benefit it brings/what problem solves. It must be like placing the piece of a puzzle in the right spot in the mind of the reader.
