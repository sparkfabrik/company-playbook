## Operating systems

This guide is available for macOS and Ubuntu.

To provision your system, just head here: https://github.com/sparkfabrik/sparkdock and follow the instructions.

## Overview

Our local development environment is built on Docker, to achieve:

* High decoupling from host OS.
* Different service versions and configurations for each application/project.
* The ability to commit the infrastructure together with the application in the same repository.
* _One-click_ local setup of projects for everyone in the team.

One image is worth a thousand words, so here follows a simplified depiction of our local environment model:

![Local environment schema](%image_url%/procedures/local-development-environment--depiction-linux.png)

What we've got here is a set of containers, related to different projects. They are interconnected via Docker links so that each project has its service: for example, both Drupal projects in the image have dedicated MySQL and Apache/PHP containers, perfectly isolated. They can be stopped and started at will on a "by project" basis.

To keep container sets isolated we rely on `docker-compose`, a simple orchestrator that's easy to configure and run locally.

To reach each entry point -- which for a web application is the HTTP server that exposes the app for that project -- we need a resolver able to dynamically map containers to URLs when a container is started or stopped (mind a container IP is inherently dynamic so a static map won't do).

The last ingredient consists of a local resolver able to inform the system to proxy the calls for a given TLD (`.loc` in our case) to `dnsdock` or by using an HTTP proxy currently implemented with `dinghy-http-proxy`.

## Why do we have `dnsdock` and `dinghy-http-proxy`

Let's start with the projects' links:

* https://github.com/aacebedo/dnsdock
* https://github.com/sparkfabrik/dinghy-http-proxy

These tools are used (as alternatives) by our internal docker-compose projects and they both enable requests generated from localhost to reach running containers by querying a domain. To avoid collisions, all local projects are mapped under a "fictional" `.loc` top-level domain.
**Important note**: please remember that every `.loc` top-level domain is mapped by these DNS resolvers, not just `sparkfabrik.loc`.

So why two options? The reason is that `dnsdock` is a viable solution for Linux environments, where your host has direct access to Docker containers network (you can reach a Docker container on its IP address) but that's not possible on macOS or Windows/WSL. In these environments, Docker is running inside a Linux VM under the hood. Different networking layers are in place that prevent a direct connection between your host and the containers.

On macOS and Windows then, `Dinghy HTTP Proxy` solves the problem from a different perspective: it exposes ports 80/443 on your host, plus a UDP port to resolve DNS queries. On those ports it proxies HTTP requests to the correct containers, responding to the browser.

The following diagrams show the respective workflows.

### DNSDock

To know if a container must be mapped by its resolver, DNSDock inspects a label or env variable exposed by containers, specifically:

```yaml
environment:
  - DNSDOCK_ALIAS:

labels:
  com.dnsdock.alias:
```

The ENV variable is going to be deprecated soon, so please **use the label only**.

#### Request flow diagram

```
title: Dnsdock

User -> System DNS: Access to "website.sparkfabrik.loc"
note: All the domains ending with ".loc" are always taken in charge by dns resolvers
System DNS -> Dnsdock: Dns query
Dnsdock -->> System DNS: _Found it: 172.12.4.13_
System DNS -> User: website.sparkfabrik.loc 172.12.4.13
User -> Container 172.12.4.13: GET /
```

### Dinghy HTTP proxy

To know if a container needs to be proxied, Dinghy HTTP Proxy inspects an env variable exposed by containers, specifically:

```yaml
environment:
  - VIRTUAL_HOST:
```

#### Request flow diagram

```
title: Dinghy http proxy

User -> System DNS: Access to "website.sparkfabrik.loc"
System DNS -> Dinghy http proxy: Dns query for ".loc" domains
Dinghy http proxy -->> System DNS: _Found it: 127.0.0.1_
note: Dinghy http proxy exposes two services:
  1. DNS on port 19322:19322
  2. HTTP on ports 80:80 - 443:443
It always returns 127.0.0.1 for all domains.

User -> Dinghy http proxy: Connect to "127.0.0.1" host "website.sparkfabrik.loc"
Dinghy http proxy -> Container: GET /
Container -> Dinghy http proxy: Response
Dinghy http proxy -> User: Response
```

## Run dnsdock or Dinghy HTTP Proxy

If you need to re-run `dnsdock` or `dinghy-http-proxy` for some reason (maybe you have deleted the containers), you can rely on `sparkdock` scripts:

1. Linux
  1. `run-dnsdock`: https://github.com/sparkfabrik/sparkdock/blob/master/config/ubuntu/bin/run-dnsdock
  2. `run-dinghy-proxy`: https://github.com/sparkfabrik/sparkdock/blob/master/config/ubuntu/bin/run-dinghy-proxy
2. macOS
  3. `run-dinghy-proxy`: https://github.com/sparkfabrik/sparkdock/blob/master/config/macosx/bin/run-dinghy-proxy

If you work in SparkFabrik with the provided hardware, those scripts should already be available in your system. In case they're missing:

**Ubuntu**

```bash
curl -slo /usr/local/bin/run-dnsdock https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfabrik/sparkdock/master/config/ubuntu/bin/run-dnsdock
curl -slo /usr/local/bin/run-dinghy-proxy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfabrik/sparkdock/master/config/ubuntu/bin/run-dinghy-proxy
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/run-dnsdock
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/run-dinghy-proxy
```

**macOS**

```bash
curl -slo /usr/local/bin/run-dinghy-proxy https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfabrik/sparkdock/master/config/macosx/bin/run-dinghy-proxy
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/run-dinghy-proxy
```

### Log into GCloud

To build our projects you'll need access to GCP image registry to start with, so you need to log in with your SparkFabrik account.

Run the following commands in the order:

```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth configure-docker
gcloud container clusters get-credentials spark-op-services --zone europe-west1-b --project spark-int-cloud-services
```

Running the first couple commands, your browser will open, asking for authorization to access your account. If you have more than one Google/Gmail account configured you'll have to explicitly choose the `sparkfabrik.com` one.

Once you run all three commands above, you're done.

### Test and enjoy

To test that everything is working as expected, we'll try to run a service in a container, exposing it through a local URL.

#### DNSDock

```bash
❯ docker run -d -e DNSDOCK_ALIAS=test.sparkfabrik.loc nginx:alpine

❯ curl test.sparkfabrik.loc | grep -i nginx

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

```
