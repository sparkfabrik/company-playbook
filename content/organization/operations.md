Operational roles apply to employees that deliver solutions to customers.  
We are talking about the people who write code, design new interfaces or take care of the operations on a cloud appliance.

## Careers

Operational career paths expand [vertically](#seniority-levels). As you work in SparkFabrik, learn new skills and take over more responsibilities, you will climb the seniority ladder and be rewarded accordingly.

During your career though, you may take different roles on different projects. This may happen because your team considers you the best one to cover that role, or because you want to learn if it is your cup of tea.  
Or maybe because nobody else is available at that very moment, and you have to bite the bullet.

Moving [horizontally](#project-roles) on different aspects of a project may be a challenge, but is an incredible accelerator for your professional growth and for becoming a key person in the company.

## Seniority levels

Each unit in the company has different seniority ladders, depending on the level of proficiency and experience.  
Each level has its salary bracket, mission, and clear expectations.

### Software Developers

Developers [progress over this career path](/working-at-sparkfabrik/career-advancement.md) by their length of service, their adaptability, their attitude, their outcomes, and by nurturing their technical and non-technical skills.

#### Junior Developer

To qualify as a junior developer you need some degree of experience with the basics and, no denying, a diploma or graduation in Computer Science or Engineering helps a lot.  
The main duties of a Junior developer are contributing clean work, building solid relations with the team, and learning daily.

#### Mid-Level Developer

When you get the hang of the [core skills](#) and have 18 months to 2 years of work on real projects under your belt, you are right on track to be called a senior developer.  
At this point producing working software in a mostly autonomous should be your daily routine. Your place and relations with the team and with the company should be clear and established.

Stepping to the next level is a matter of widening your technical knowledge as well as understanding how a project unfolds, and experience how it is to work in certain [roles](#project-roles).

#### Senior Developer

Seniority is about managing relations and processes as it is about technical proficiency.

This title is for developers with three or more years of expertise in the field, who know their toolchains in and out, can learn new technologies with ease, shape the delivery processes with their team, support and mentor their younger colleagues, and probably cover one or more [roles](#project-roles)](#project-roles) on their projects.

#### Professional developers

This is the career pinnacle for developers in SparkFabrik and it's not for everyone. Those we call Professional Developers are the people that embody our culture, can work with one or multiple teams at once, represent SparkFabrik at important tables, provide training and mentorships and proactively contribute to the success of our mission.

Professional Developers may still cover any [role](#project-roles) on a specific project, but they may as well work cross-team or be appointed as reference key people.

### Cloud Engineers

#### TBD

### Solution Designers

## Project Roles

We broadly recognize four _Specialities_ that qualify you as a developer and do our best to make you shine following your nature. During your career, you will probably cover more than a single speciality, even at the same time.

* **Team Leader**: Managers make things work. They coach, measure, plan, steer and ultimately support people to give their best, remove obstacles, and improve their processes and procedures. In SparkFabrik people are never managed -- work is. So managers govern but never rule.
* **Analyst**: Analysts are great when it comes to mapping a domain, fathoming complexity and expressing it in a clear, rational, understandable form. Analysts may not always have a solution at hand but for sure they know when a need is fulfilled or a problem is solved. Analysts' skills make for great Product Owners.
* **Architect**: Architects describe the best possible solution to a framed problem. They are great decision makers, understand the long-term implications of technical choices, know how to quickly probe, understand and adapt and always grasp the big picture.
* **Specialist**: Specialists are vertically experts in a discipline or area: be it writing software, cloud operations, Agile or UX design. Those are the keenest to work in pair with project teams in the long run when there are critical challenges.
