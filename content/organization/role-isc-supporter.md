## Attitude

### Clarity

You are an organizational and procedural reference for both employees and management. You live by and shape clearly defined practices and help others creating new ones.

### Fluidity

You do your best to facilitate administrative and organizational processes. You build bridges across the whole company and work hard to highlight and remove wastes and obstacles as you identify them. You listen what happens at all levels and help both management and workforce find a common ground when you feel they lack the proper alignment.

### Proactivity

You know when to take promptly decisions, even on partial data, or require management validation. You perceive the impacts your choices will have on the company and make sure you always work to fulfill the current strategy. You face challenges proactively, not waiting for others to solve problems for you. You handle chaotic situations without losing your mind and help others making sense of them.

### Teamwork

You share your goals with the management and work with them. You also explain your needs or decisions to the workforce so that they'll be on your same page and understand the real value you want delivered. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubbornness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.

### Self-organization

Your own schedule and workload balance is your responsibility. You have clear what's expected from you and step up to discuss conflicting priorities and possible bottlenecks with the management.

### Lucidity

You have clear what outcomes are expected from your work and what you have to do to match the expectation. When you feel like your goals or process outcomes are confused, you speak up and do your best to have them clear.

### Strong opinions, lightly held

You speak your mind and sustain your ideas with words and facts, but you are open to criticism and listen with open ears.
