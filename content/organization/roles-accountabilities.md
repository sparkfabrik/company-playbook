## Shared accountability

We all share a set of accountabilities, regardless of our job position and role in any specific project:

### Client satisfaction

The client is not always right, or they would not turn to us to solve their problems. Still, [we value technical quality and good human relations over everything else](https://www.sparkfabrik.com/en/the-manifesto/). Be kind and clear, explain your positions and always focus on customer needs, with open ears and a bright smile. Everybody is called to ultimately deliver a great customer experience.

### Delivering projects

Simple as it sounds. On time, on budget, on specs.

### Respecting your colleagues

Be friendly. Keep in mind that we share the same goal but each of us may have different ways to achieve it. Always presume everybody is well-meaning and help them to improve. Don't waste other people's time: be timely at meetings, point out when others forget something and clearly state your requirements or needs so others shouldn't try to figure out what you mean.

### Supporting your colleagues

Work with others so that they can grow. Add to their knowledge. Help them if they are in need but don't steal the spotlight: let them do the work so they can improve. Point out when others can meet the highest standard. Don't keep to yourself information that can help others succeed.

### Following company processes

We prefer processes and evolutionary agreements over rules. Still, we want everybody to follow those processes and respect evolutionary agreements. Everybody is involved in shaping them so everybody must respect them.

## Per-role accountabilities

Operational roles are described in terms of **impact assessment cards**: documents that describe the expected positive impact a role has on the business.

As you take on new roles and possibly even move between specialties (we love multi-talented people), your specific accountabilities will be described by one (or more) assessment cards.
