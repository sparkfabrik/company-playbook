## Corporate Functions

The employees in this area are responsible for the supporting processes.

Each employee in this area has a direct or almost direct report to one or more [Executive Board members](/organization/governance#executive-board) and they all have either a directional role or the [Supporter](/organization/company-role-acc-supporter) company role.

Supporters are employees owning one or more processes and procedures vital to the health of the company.  
They can [assess their impacts](/working-at-sparkfabrik/impact-assessment) as any other operational role and, if not for the nature of their duties, they are subject to the same requirements and quality standards.
