## Shared accountability

We all share a set of accountabilities, regardless of our job position and role in any specific project.

### Client satisfaction

The client is not always right, or they would not ask us for help to solve their problems. Yet the client always has their good reasons.
Remember [we value quality in human relations](https://www.sparkfabrik.com/en/the-manifesto/) as much as we value quality in software. Be always kind and clear, keep your integrity, make your point with honesty and don't just nod to everything, but listen with open ears to customers' needs.

Ultimately, everybody is called to deliver a great customer experience.

### Delivering your outputs

Simple as it sounds. On time, on budget, on specs.

### Respecting your colleagues

Be friendly. Keep in mind that we share the same goal but each of us may have different ways to achieve it. Always presume everybody is well-meaning and help them to improve. Don't waste other people's time: be timely at meetings, point out when others forget something and clearly state your requirements or needs so others shouldn't try to figure out what you mean.

### Supporting your colleagues

Work with others so that they can grow. Add to their knowledge. Help them if they are in need but don't steal the spotlight: let them do the work so they can improve. Point out when others can meet the highest standard. Don't keep to yourself information that can help others succeed.

### Following company processes

We prefer processes and evolutionary agreements over rules. Still, we want everybody to follow those processes and respect evolutionary agreements. Everybody is involved in shaping them so everybody must respect them.

## Seniority-related accountabilities

Operational accountabilities are described in terms of the expected positive impacts a role has on the business.

As you gain [seniority](/organization/operations#seniority-levels) and possibly take over one or more [roles on your projects](/organization/operations#project-roles), your specific accountabilities will change.

## Project-roles accountabilities

Project-related accountabilities are described in terms of their ownership, practical tasks and expected observable outputs.

The accent is on practices because these roles are ofter taken up by developers, engineers, designers and in general by colleagues with a technical expertise. Also, this model does not conflict with the shared and seniority-related accountabilites listed above.

Different models are available based on the delivery area.
