Description: Governance roles and functions in SparkFabrik
Sort: 20
*/

Governance in SparkFabrik is organized by functions, not roles.  
C-level roles are assigned to key people, who generally own government functions. Owning doesn't imply the function is completely carried out by that person. Professionals and lead developers at the operational level cooperate with the government function owner to make it happen.

## Executive Board

The executive board is in charge of the strategy and business planning of the company.  
The current board is composed of company founders, with the following duties.

* **Stefano Mainardi**: CEO - Responsible for the overall progress of the company. Praised for success, and held responsible for setbacks.
* **Paolo Pustorino**: Head of HR - Responsible for workforce training, development, management, recruitment, rewarding, compliance and ethos.
* **Marco Giacomassi**: CFO - Oversees the company's financials. Responsible for budgeting, accounting, reporting, forecasting and investing.
* **Paolo Mainardi**: CTO - Oversees the company's technology. Works to ensure that technology-related decisions align with business goals.
* **Alessio Piazza**: COO - Oversees the company's day-to-day operations, sourcing, process control, resource allocation and activity planning.

## Steering committee

The steering committee works to overcome organizational problems and advance the company's practices. It operates constantly on top of the projects level, overseeing the processes, validating methodologies and improving the whole delivery process.

This committee is composed of the CTO, COO, Head of HR, all Professionals and all Lead Developers in the company.
The owner of Steering committee events is the COO.

Each quarter (the first Wednesday of each quarter's first month) the committee has a 2-hour facilitated meeting in which they define:

* Top priorities to be addressed (C-levels can set them or call for co-generation and voting)
* State top priorities in terms of initiatives
* Willing people can apply as owners of those initiatives

Initiatives clearly state SMART goals to address the related top priority. They should bring a change or even revolutionize an aspect of our work, such as introducing new technology, changing an organizational approach, introducing longed-for tools, etc.

Owners commit to lead the completion of the initiative goals by the end of the quarter. Initiative owners will be publicly appointed. We want those people to challenge themselves and take on additional responsibilities to shape those skills that may in the future make them C-levels.

The format of the quarterly meeting is aggressively timeboxed:

* 20 mins: Identify and list weaknesses or opportunities for improvement in the current approach.
* 30 mins: Define goals for a better condition (1 to 3 goals depending on the size).
* 30 mins: Generate SMART initiatives for the quarter that fulfills the goals.
* 20 mins: Appoint a single owner for each initiative.
* 10 mins: Define a scheduled session within 7 days where the owner will present and discuss his incremental plan to the completion of the goals (this will allow resource planning and assignment).

The presentation of the initiative plan must include:

* Quantification/qualification of time and resources required to fulfill the goal.
* A list of the deliverables to be expected (tools, docs, materials, etc).
* A calendar for brown bags/internal presentations to review increments with the whole company.
* If and how the company is expected to support the initiative deliverables, during the quarter and in the future (say, open source contributions etc).
* A list of outward-facing material to communicate how your initiative is making a difference, such as blog posts, events speeches or the maintenance of open source contributions.

While the initiative should be completed in the quarter, the ownership won't stop there: communication, promotion and ongoing maintenance may last longer; owners are thus expected to commit to the initiative for a longer period than the initial quarter.
