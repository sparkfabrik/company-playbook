*/

Governance in SparkFabrik is organized in functions, not roles.  
C-level roles are assigned to key people, that generally own government functions. Owning doesn't imply the function is totally carried out by that person. Professionals and lead developers at operational level cooperate with the government function owner to make it happen.

## Executive board

The executive board is in charge for the strategy and business planning of the company.  
Current board is composed by company founders, with the following duties.

* **Stefano Mainardi**: CEO - Responsible for the overall progress of the company. Praised for success, and held responsible for setback.
* **Paolo Pustorino**: Head of HR - Responsible for workforce training, development, management, recruitment, rewarding, compliance and ethos.

## Steering committee

The steering committee works to overcome organizational problems and advance company's practices. It operate on a constant basis on top of the projects level, overseeing the processes, validating methodologies and improving the whole delivery process.

This committee is composed by the CTO, COO, Head of HR, all Professionals and all Lead Developers in the company.
The owner of Steering committee events is the COO.

Each quarter (the first Wednesday of each quarter first month) the committee has a 2 hours facilitated meeting in which they define:

* Top priorities to be addressed (C-levels can set them or call for co-generation and voting)
* State top priorities in terms of initatives
* Willing people can apply as owners of those initiatives

Initiatives clearly states SMART goals to address the related top priority. They should bring a change or even revolutionize an aspect of our work, such as introducing a new technology, change an organizational approach, introducing longed-for tools, etc.

Owners commit to lead the completion of the initiative goals by the end of the quarter. Initiative owners will be pubblicly appointed. We want those people to challenge themselves and take on additional responsibilities to shape those skills that may in the future make them C-levels.

The format of the quarterly meeting is aggressively timeboxed:

* 20 mins: Identify and list weaknesses or opportunities for improvement in current approach.
* 30 mins: Define goals for a better condition (1 to 3 goals depending on the size).
* 30 mins: Generate SMART initiatives for the quarter that fulfills the goals.
* 20 mins: Appoint a single owner for each initiative.
* 10 mins: Define a scheduled session within 7 days where the owner will present and discuss his incremental plan to the completion of the goals (this will allow resource planning and assignement).

The presentation of the initiative plan must include:

* Quantification/qualification of time and resources necessary to fulfill the goal.
* A list of the deliverables to be expected (tools, docs, materials, etc).
* A calendar for brown bags/internal presentation to review increments with the whole company.
* If and how the company is expected to support the initiative deliverables, during the quarter and in the future (say, open source contributions etc).
* A list of outward facing material to communicate how your initiative is making a difference, such as blog posts, events speeches or the maintenance of open source contributions.

While the initiative should be completed in the quarter, the ownership won't stop there: communication, promotion and ongoing maintenance may last longer and owners are supposed to take the commitment.
