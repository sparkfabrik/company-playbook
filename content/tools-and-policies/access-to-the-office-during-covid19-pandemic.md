Following the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, from October 2020 Sparkfabrik's office in Milan is open again for who wants or needs to work there.

The access is possible at reduced capacity, **only during working hours** (9:00-19:00) from Monday to Friday and by reservation.
Only **10 people** at the same time will be admitted to the office and only at specific seats/desks.

Limitations also apply to access the meeting rooms and common areas.

## Booking a seat
