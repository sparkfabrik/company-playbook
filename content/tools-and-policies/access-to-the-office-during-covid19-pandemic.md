Following the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown, from October 2020 Sparkfabrik's office in Milan is open again for who wants or needs to work there.

The access is possible at reduced capacity, **only during working hours** (9:00-19:00) from Monday to Friday and by reservation.  
Only **10 people** at the same time will be admitted to the office and only at specific seats/desks.

Limitations also apply to access the meeting rooms and common areas.

## Booking a seat

To book access to the office, write to office-booking@sparkfabrik.com.
Wait for a confirmation e-mail. To know who's in the office, take a look at this calendar.

## Accessing the office

At the office entrance those items can be found:

* The sanitizing gel.
* A contactless thermometer.
* An access log (paper).
* A sheet for the delegation of the safety manager.
* Surgical masks.
* A proxy sheet (for the first person entering the office, see [Responsible of security](#responsible-of-security) below).

The access is allowed according to the following safety rules:

* At the entrance, you **MUST** wear the mask.
* You **MUST** sanitize their hands with the gel.
* You **MUST** have you temperature measured and written down: should the body temperature exceed 37.5°C, you won't be allowed to access the office.
* You **MUST** log your presence on the register.

## Responsible of security

The first person who enters the office must sign the proxy sheet at the entrance and leave it in the box.  
This person is appointed the **Responsible for Security** role and will have to check the temperature to anyone entering the office and make sure the safety rules above are respected.

## Other indications

Once in the office, keep in mind that:

We have set up **two seats for each island** in order to maintain an adequate distance. Do not move the seats and respect 1.5m distancing when not wearing masks. If this is not possible, wear masks!

**No seat is considered personal**. When you book a seat for a day you can take the first free seat you spot or prefer.  

Your personal keyboard, mouse and headphones (the stuff you touch) are all in a box in a cabinet in the first room. Take them when you enter and bring them to your desk of choice.  
On each desk you'll find sanitizing wipes and alcohol-based gel. **Before going out, put your things in the box and sanitize the desk with wipes**. Please leave the desk clear of devices, books or other objects.

The use of the meeting room is limited to a maximum of **4 people** at a time, by reservation (same booking rules apply).

The use of the small room is restricted to **one person** at a time, by reservation (same booking rules apply).

After using the bathroom, **sanitize the handles** with the special wipes; also **spray the sanitizing products on the surfaces** you have used/touched.

Access to the kitchen is restricted to **one person** at a time.

Access to the relax room is restricted to **a maximum of 4 people** at a time.
