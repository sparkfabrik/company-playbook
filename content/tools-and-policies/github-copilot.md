## What is

GitHub Copilot is a new AI-powered code assistant from GitHub that helps developers write code faster and with less effort. Imagine it like an Intellisense charged with superpowers.

It uses machine learning to understand the context of the code you are writing and provides suggestions and code snippets to help you complete your tasks.

The tool suggests as you type, it's context-aware, meaning they will change based on the type of file you are working on and the code you have written so far and you will always be in control of which suggestion is actually fit for purpose

Additionally, GitHub Copilot has a "Code Navigation" feature that lets you quickly jump to specific parts of your code by typing in keywords or phrases. You can also search for specific functions or classes within your codebase and navigate to them directly.

If used with care and applying the necessary critical thinking, it can help developers write code faster and more accurately

It can be used within the most used IDE and editor (including vim, yes); just follow the instructions in the official documentation to integrate it into your editor of choice.

For a quick introduction about Copilot and how it does its magic, we suggest [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inr1fFxvFAw), where Rizèl Scarlett shows the tool in action in different scenarios.
