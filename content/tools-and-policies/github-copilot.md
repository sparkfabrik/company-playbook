## What is

GitHub Copilot is a new AI-powered code assistant from GitHub that helps developers write code faster and with less effort. Imagine it like an Intellisense charged with superpowers.

It uses machine learning to understand the context of the code you are writing and provides suggestions and code snippets to help you complete your tasks.

You can select a suggestion or code snippet to insert into your code. The suggestions and code snippets are context-aware, meaning they will change based on the type of file you are working on and the code you have written so far.

Additionally, GitHub Copilot has a "Code Navigation" feature that lets you quickly jump to specific parts of your code by typing in keywords or phrases. You can also search for specific functions or classes within your codebase and navigate to them directly.

GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool that can help developers write code faster and more accurately. It uses machine learning to understand the context of your code and provides suggestions and code snippets to help you complete your tasks more efficiently.

It can be used within the most used IDE and editor (including vim, yes); just follow the instructions in the official documentation to integrate it into your editor of choice.
