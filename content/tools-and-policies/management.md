## Redmine

    @todo summarize what we use Redmine for and link specific articles and recipes to help people get the info they need

## Float

    @todo same as for Redmine

## Slack

    @todo
    - Describe how project channels are organized (and MUST BE organized - link to meaningful recipes)
    - List general purpose channels, their topics, what can be discussed and what not
    - Give information on how to set the online status to inform others of your availability

## Gmail

    @todo nothing terrible to be said here, if not for subscription to G+ so that hangout is available and maybe the usage of company accounts for personal purposes (related to the migration of emails in case of resignation)

## Hangout

    @todo general description

## Google Drive

    @todo 
    - describe folder structure and organization. Permissions are set by the app itself so it won't hurt to have a full description of all the main folders
    - describe the document naming conventions (AAAAMMDDXX prefix and such), useful to make documents searchable with ease
    - point out the "add to my drive" feature, to make users able to search for documents shared by others (or better yet, have a policy to NOT create docs outside of shared folders!)

## Trello

    @todo give a list of boards useful to the team for non-productive task tracking:
    - BBA
    - Blog ideas
    - Parking lot for remote users?

## Other communication channels

    @todo describe how to use:
    - Telegram chat channel
    - Skype
    - Others?
