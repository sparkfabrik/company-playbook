## Attitude

### Teamwork

You share your goals with your mates and work with them, never playing the hero or being a team of one. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubborness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.

### Self-organization

Your own schedule and workload balance is your responsibility. You have clear what's expected to you each iteration (week, sprint, milestone) and step up to discuss conflicting priorities and possible bottlenecks with the management.

### Lucidity

You have clear what's expected from you and what you have to do to match the expectation. When you feel like you lost your goals, you speak up and do your best to have them clear.

### Awareness

You perceive the overall impacts of your day-to-day choices and know when to ask for validation. You face challenges proactively, not always waiting for others to solve problems for you, but know when to stop and ask for help to avoid wasting time or losing your mind on things bigger than you.

You speak your mind and sustain your ideas with words and facts, but you are open to criticism and listen with open ears.
