People in Sparkfabrik should expect to advance on their career path almost constantly.  
Growth is awarded by the combination of two mechanisms.

## Length of service

We value people to stick with us.  
Turnover is costly and investement on team building pays more in the long term. That's why we want people to stay around. We reward anyone with a salary increase after 3, 5, 7 and 10 years of work. This happens automatically, regardless of performance and will go beyond the tenth year.

## Impact scoring

This practice is heavily inspired by how [Deeson](https://www.deeson.co.uk) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) help their employees achieve their goals and commit to their duties.

Once every three months each developer attend a [1:1 meeting](/our-company/one-to-one-meetings). Among other things, [Impact scoring](/our-company/impact-scoring) will be evaluated and discussed in that occasion, to measure your growth on the various business-impacting aspects.

Repetively scoring above a certain threshold (@TODO: WHAT THRESHOLD?) will allow you to be assigned a higher role. Stepping up on your career path will then be based on adherence to values and the actual impact you make, not on personal perception of your value.

Stepping up will impact:

* your salary following [this table](/job-roles/salaries#salary-variations);
* your duties in accordance to your new [impact scoring card](/our-company/impact-scoring-cards).

## Taking the challenge

To fullfill [its vision](), Sparkfabrik sells and cultivate high seniorities. Thus we expect junior developers to work hard to step up and we **require** that, once the proper goals are completed they will be ready to take the responsibilities of a senior developer.

Not all senior developers crave to become leaders or top professionals, instead. This is understandable and we respect the choice. 
When a senior developer's meets the requirements for a career advancement, we will present her the opportunity, explaining new role's benefit, expectations and duties. It is to the developer to take or leave.

We encourage everybody to accept the challenge and may, in many cases, probe people that already refused as we see an occasion for her to shine, but won't push or force any advancement.

Still we expect **every senior developer** to constantly increase her scoring and set new professional goals, maybe tackling new [Specialities](job-roles/operations#specialities) in their career, making side steps instead of climbing the ledder.
