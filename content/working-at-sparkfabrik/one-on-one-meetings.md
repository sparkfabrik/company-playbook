One-on-one (1:1) meetings are regular check-ins between the company and individual employees. They provide a scheduled opportunity to discuss the employee experience and maintain a direct line of communication.

Two kinds of 1:1 meetings usually take place at SparkFabrik.

The first is with HR professionals and focuses on addressing concerns, providing support, and monitoring employee well‑being. These meetings are organized by the HR department at a set cadence, as described on this page.

The second happens on demand between teammates (usually a Team Leader, Project Manager, or another more experienced team member) and an employee on their team. These meetings focus on performance, career progression, and goal setting. If you need tips on running these meetings, [see the dedicated guide](/guides/how-to-conduct-one-on-ones.md).

## Foreword

Our one-on-one format is inspired in spirit and practice by the "24 questions to ask in your next 1:1 meeting" post by Jason Lauritsen on the Small Improvements blog.

HR representatives and team leads who conduct one-on-ones are expected to read the post and draw inspiration from it.

## Cadence

The company ensures every employee has at least two one-on-one meetings each year. Employees in operational roles will meet with a designated HR representative.  
There are no prerequisites. An effective agenda appears below, but to get the most from the meeting, come prepared with topics to discuss.

One-on-ones with your Team Leader, manager, or direct report are good opportunities to talk about your career, performance, and professional goals. If helpful, we strongly recommend you [prepare a performance self-assessment](/working-at-sparkfabrik/performance-review). Optionally, ask for feedback from your manager or a senior teammate — this is especially useful for junior developers.

## Goal

The one-on-one meeting is **not** a control exercise or a top-down lecture. It is a meeting for the employee, with these goals:

* Receive honest feedback
* Provide honest feedback
* Discuss impediments
* Set short-term goals and review previous ones

## Agenda

To meet the goals above, we suggest the following agenda for a 60-minute meeting:

1. **Warm-up** (5 mins): What is the single most important thing we should discuss today? Adjust or override the following agenda if needed.
2. **Celebration** (10 mins): What are your most significant accomplishments since we last met? Have you met the goals set previously?
3. **Impediments** (15 mins): What obstacles are you encountering right now? Where do you need support?
4. **Next goals** (15 mins): What will you focus on before our next meeting? Can we write this as a [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goal?
5. **Offer to help** (10 mins): What can we, as managers, do differently to support you?
6. **Facilitator feedback** (5 mins): How was this one-on-one for you? How can I improve as a facilitator?

## Outcome

HR will take notes about the meeting in PeopleForce (our HR-management tool). Talking points, action items, and notes are stored there and are accessible only to the meeting participants. Comments may be added after the meeting if needed.

When relevant, outcomes may be shared with company governance and, if applicable, with team leaders.

See [the guide on 1:1s](/guides/how-to-conduct-one-on-ones.md#recording-outcomes) for details on recording notes and follow-up.
