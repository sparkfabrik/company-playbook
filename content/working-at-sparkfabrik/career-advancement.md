At SparkFabrik, employees can expect career advancement based on their interests and initiative. The company provides equal opportunities for growth, rewarding results and commitment. Progress requires seizing opportunities, gaining experience, delivering results, and developing both technical and interpersonal skills.

Operational career paths expand both **vertically** (see [seniority level](/organization/operations#seniority-levels)) and **horizontally** (see [project roles](/organization/operations#project-roles)).

## Seniority and vertical growth

To fulfil [our vision](https://www.sparkfabrik.com/en/the-manifesto/), SparkFabrik aims to hire and develop high-seniority professionals. We generally expect junior developers to progress toward senior roles over time.

Time alone does not make someone a senior. Developing seniority takes sustained effort. Technical knowledge matters, but so do professional presence, pattern recognition across contexts, strong soft skills, the ability to contribute in different ways, and broad domain knowledge.

Working across projects and participating in the company community helps you advance.

You can assess your level by [reviewing your performance](/working-at-sparkfabrik/performance-review). This model focuses on quality and reduces subjective impressions in evaluations.

To check whether you match a level or can cover a specific role, review the [accountabilities of your target position](/organization/accountabilities) and perform a self-assessment using the relative performance review scorecard.

For guidance, ask your manager (team leader) or a senior colleague to help evaluate your performance in light of the scorecard.

The scorecard tries to make expectations clear: you either meet what's expected from a role, or you identify where to invest effort. Set achievable goals and, if you need resources, opportunities, or advice from SparkFabrik, request a meeting with your manager or HR. The company will support your success.

## Project Roles and horizontal growth

Successful projects need strong analysis, disciplined direction, and solid architecture. Project roles require responsibility and leadership. These are not for everyone.

As you grow and reveal your strengths, you may be asked to take on responsibilities such as analyst, solution architect, or team leader. You might prefer to specialize in domain analysis, team coordination, architecture, or other areas. Sometimes the company will invite you to take a challenge; other times you may volunteer.

Taking on a project role is a significant step in your development. You may cover multiple roles over your career, sometimes concurrently.

Some roles require a minimum seniority. For example, Solution Architect is typically for Senior and Lead Developers. Team Leader roles may be filled by developers with strong organisational and people skills, even if they have less experience with on the technical side.

Horizontal growth lets you move across roles: you might be an analyst on one project and a team leader on another, or step back into coding or design between leadership stints.

When the company recognises you as ready for a new role, we'll offer you the opportunity. We'll explain the role’s benefits, expectations, and duties. The choice then, is yours.

## Advance your career

When you meet the requirements to level up your seniority or take on a project role, we will discuss it and reward you accordingly.

If you’d like to discuss your proficiency or explore being tested in a specific role, contact an HR representative and we’ll arrange a review, map opportunities, and create a practical plan.
We will help you understand the new role's benefits, expectations, and duties. It's up to you to take or leave.
