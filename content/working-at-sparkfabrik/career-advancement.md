*/

People in SparkFabrik should expect to advance on their career path, depending on their inclinations and will. The company will work to give equal opportunities for growth to everyone, rewarding results and commitment.
Progressing requires seizing these opportunities, accruing tenure, achieving results, and nurturing both technical and non-technical skills.

Operational career paths expand **vertically** (per [seniority level](/organization/operations#seniority-levels)) and horizontally (per [Project Roles](/organization/operations#project-roles)).

## How to advance

We track and rule people's career advancement to make it fair and clear to everybody.

### Checkpoints

Each developer can assess their overall level of proficiency by their [impact assessment](/working-at-sparkfabrik/impact-assessment), a qualitative measure of the expected positive outcome of our work<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.

Stepping up on your career path will then be based on adherence to values and the actual impact you make, not on personal perception of your merit.  
Each developer role model has its impact assessment card.

To understand if you can cover a specific role, you can take the role's IAC and self-assess how well you are fulfilling the expectations.  
Or you can reach out to your responsible (your team leader or direct report), asking for their feedback.

The IAC result is pretty self-explanatory. Either you match or exceed the role's expectations, or you get an idea about where to invest to grow your skills.  
Ask for a meeting with your manager or an HR representative to set your goals and make sure the company will do its best to help you be successful.

### Stepping up

Taking a new role will impact:

* your salary according to the baselines for that role (may change over time);
* your duties following your new [accountability sheet](/organization/accountabilities#seniority-related-accountabilities).

### Taking the challenge

To fulfill [its vision](https://www.sparkfabrik.com/en/the-manifesto/), SparkFabrik sells and cultivates high seniorities. We generally expect junior developers to eventually become senior developers.

Still, despite nobody can consciously avoid learning from experience, not all juniors want to take over the responsibilities of a senior. And not all seniors crave to become team leaders or software architects. This is understandable and we respect the choice.  

Every time you will match the requirements for career advancement, and if the company recognizes in you the qualities to cover a new role, you'll be granted the opportunity to take it over.  
We will help you understand the new role's benefits, expectations and duties. It's up to you to take or leave.

We encourage everybody to take the challenge and we may even probe people who already refused if we see a new opportunity for them to shine, but we can't push or force any advancement.

Still, we expect **every developer** to constantly increase their assessment and set new professional goals, maybe tackling new [Specialities](/organization/operations#specialities) in their career, making side steps instead of climbing a ladder.
