## Why measure performance

People have different ambitions and expectations for their careers. As a growing company, we need fair, unbiased ways to evaluate and reward performance.

Our _evidence-based_ performance review model gives a compass to those who want to grow, take on new responsibilities, and advance their careers. The model guides individual development, aligns it with company expectations, and highlights signs of professional progress.

You may want to review your performance to:

* Understand what is expected of you and identify areas to improve.
* Periodically track your growth and collect external feedback with help from a senior colleague or your manager.

## How it works

We don't want people to work solely to meet KPIs. We want them to share our values and contribute to our culture.

> A culture is the set of predominant **attitudes** and **behaviors** that characterize a group or organization.

Numbers are useful as high-level indicators, but they rarely explain the underlying causes, especially when people are involved. Throughput and output vary for many reasons, including factors outside work.

They are important, but we focuse on _outcomes_.

We describe each role by its desired outcomes, not by a checklist of tasks. Employees are then evaluated based on observable behaviors that contribute to those outcomes.

Making expected behaviors explicit aligns individual actions with our culture and clarifies how everyone can contribute.

Each employee has [accountabilities](/organization/accountabilities#seniority-related-accountabilities) based on seniority level and project role. For each seniority level, a **Performance Review** scorecard lists the observable behaviors expected at that level.

Reviews rate how consistently a behavior is enacted using a simple three-point scale:

* **Fully observed**: Clear evidence the behavior is consistently and fully enacted.
* **Partially observed**: Partial, inconsistent, or limited evidence that the behavior is enacted. Or clear evidence that the behavior is inconsistently or partially enacted.
* **Not observed**: No evidence that the behavior is enacted.

You are encouraged to bring evidence to the reviewer if it helps clarify your contributions. Consistency matters when marking a behavior as _Fully observed_.

## When to review your performance

You can complete a self-evaluation at any time. You may also ask your manager to review your performance on demand, for example:

* If you feel lost about your [role and duties](/organization/accountabilities) and want to refocus.
* If you want to check whether you're ready for a [step up in your career](/working-at-sparkfabrik/career-advancement).
* Before requesting a raise, to determine whether it is justified.

In addition, HR runs a full evaluation of operational staff every six months, typically coordinated with one-on-one meetings.

## Who is my reviewer

* If you have an **operational role** (Developer, Designer, Platform Engineer, etc.), your reviewer is usually your manager (typically your Team Leader or a senior team member).
* If you are a Team Leader or Delivery Manager, the reviewer is the PMO or COO. Customer feedback may also be collected.
* If you have a corporate role, this model may not apply, as those roles often use different evaluation methods.

## Self-assessment vs external feedback

Self-assessment helps you reflect on your behaviors and focus your effort. It clarifies what's expected from you. It also helps evaluate readiness for promotion.

We strive for objectivity, but external feedback is vital. Performance is about impact on others: customers, colleagues, and collaborators. What seems like a good behavior to you may be received differently by others.

For this reason, self-assessments are not treated as final official results for career progression.

### Being assessed

Receiving feedback can be hard, especially when it's negative. Still, open conversations help uncover the reasons behind each remark. **Honest feedback is one of the strongest drivers of growth.** Different people will see you from different perspectives; use that input to improve the social and leadership skills needed for more visible roles such as lead developer or team leader.

If you believe a review is unfair, you can ask an HR representative to review the evaluation with you and the evaluator together.

### Assessing someone else

Giving honest feedback is difficult. You may be tempted to be too lenient, avoid difficult topics, or let recent frustrations skew your judgment.

When providing feedback, explain your reasons and offer concrete guidance on how the person can improve. If the conversation becomes tense, focus on constructive steps rather than blame. The goal of feedback is to help your colleague do better next time. Assume good intent and the ability to improve.
