## Why measuring performance

Each of us has different ambitions and expectations for our careers, and as any growing company, we faced the problem of unbiased performance metrics and rewarding mechanisms.

With an _evidence-based_ performance review model, SparkFabrik is hopefully providing a map and a compass to those who want to grow, step up and take over new roles and responsibilities.  
Our model aims to be a comprehensive framework for performance review and rewarding, but also to remain highly effective in guiding individuals' growth, aligning it with the company's expectations, as well as highlighting the signs of each person's professional advancement.

You may want to review your performance to:

* Understand what's expected from you and where you can improve your skills, in terms of self-evaluation.
* Periodically check your growth and results by collecting external feedback, with the help of a senior colleague or direct responsible.

## How it works

We don't like when people work to jump the bar of a KPI. We want them to share our values and culture.

> A culture is the set of predominant **attitudes** and **behaviors** that characterize a group or organization.

Numbers are useful high-level indicators, but they are of little help when you want to understand the true reasons behind local phenomena. Especially when people are involved. People _throughput_ and _ouput_ can vary depending on many influencing factors, even outside the professional sphere.

SparkFabrik's focus is on _outcome_.

We describe the duties of each role starting from the desired outcome, not by listing tasks and procedures we put in place. Then we evaluate our employees based on their observable behaviors.

By making clear which behaviors we expect from our colleagues, we align them with our culture. The same everyone is called to preserve and contribute to, in their own way.

Each employee has [accountabilities](/organization/accountabilities#seniority-related-accountabilities) that come from their seniority level and role on a project. For each seniority level, a **Peformance Review** sheet is available, which lists all the observable behaviors we expect from a person of that seniority.

Reviews boils down to specify the degree at which this behavior is enacted, on a simple scale of three values:

* **Fully observed**: The reviewer has evidence that this behavior is consistently and completely enacted.
* **Partially observed**: The reviewer has partial or inconsistence evidence of behavior enaction, or a clear evidence of a partial enaction.
* **Not observed**: The reviewer has no evidence that you are enacting the behavior.

Of course, it's ok to **bring** evidences to the reviewer if they can't have them themselves. Just remember that, generally speaking, consistency is important to mark a _Fully observed_ result.

## When to review your performance

You can fill in a self-evaluation every time you feel like it. Because why not?  
You may also want to ask your responsible (see below) to review your performance _on demand_, in one of these cases:

* When you feel lost about your [role and duties](/organization/accountabilities) and want to check in on them to focus on what's important
* When you want to check if you are ready for a [step up in your career](/working-at-sparkfabrik/career-advancement)
* Before asking for a raise, so you know if it's well deserved and why

Beside these occasions, the HR department will call for a complete evaluation of the whole operational staff, every 6 months, usually on time for one-on-one meetings.

## Who is my reviewer

* If you have an **operational role** (Developer, Designer, Platform Engineer, etc), your responsible. Usually your Team Leader or a senior member of your team.
* If you are a Team Leader or Delivery Manager, the PMO or COO. Also, the customers your work with can be surveyed to collect feedback.
* If you have a corporate role, your performance may not be reviewed with this model, because you're working in a highly exposed environment, where your duties have short-term impacts and your skills are easy to assess.

## Self-assessment vs external feedback

Trying to assess yourself is not an exercise in futility: thinking about your behaviors and how you make them evident to those around you should - hopefully - help you focus your effort and give your a clear understanding of what's expected from you. It should also make it clear if you are ready to step up in your career.

We did our best to create an objective evalution framework, but since we focus on quality and substance, receiving an external feedback is vital to your growth.  
The whole point is about the impact we have on others: our customers, our colleage and everyone we work with or for. What can be the best possibile _implementation_ of a behaviour in your eyes, can be received in a different way, or may impact others in ways you don't consider.

That's why self-assessment are never considered official results when it comes to your career ladder.

### Being assessed

Receiving feedback can be hard, especially when it is negative. Yet, it's important to sustain the conversation openly and get all the reasons behind each remark. Even when it's difficult to take, **honest feedback is the most valuable propellent for your growth**.  
Different people will see you in different lights and from different perspectives. This is also food for thought and will help you nurture social skills, useful if you want to become a lead developer, or when you will take an exposed project role like team leader or analyst.

If you feel you got an unfair review from your colleague, **you can have an HR representative review the evaluation** with you and the evaluator at the same table.

### Assessing someone else

It may be difficult and uncomfortable to give honest feedback. You may be tempted to be too soft, too rewarding, shy away from harsh topics, etc. Or, quite the opposite you may be in rage for something really bad that recently happened and be tempted to bash your colleague with a bad evaluation, calling off months of good work and wiping the slate clean.  
Having to explain your reasons may help you be more objective. Should the conversation become difficult, try to explain to your assessee how they may succeed in the future instead of just pointing out how badly they failed. But don't sweep the dirt under the carpet. **Remember that the reason you are providing feedback is to allow your mate to do a better job next time**. Always talk as you trust they will. Because you do.
