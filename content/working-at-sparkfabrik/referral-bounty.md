## What's a Referral Bounty Program

Finding new professionals is a challenging task. Finding the right ones, those who are a good fit for the company is even more difficult.  
Getting to know each other, building trust and deciding to take the chance is a process that requires effort and resources. But this is way simpler when your are introduced by someone you trust.

SparkFabrik's Referral Bounty Program is a way to incentivize the word-of-mouth and shorten paths between possible future colleagues.

If you know anyone who you think is a good fit for a role we are searching for, step up! You'll be rewarded with a monetary bonus.

## How This Works

* Keep an eye on our [open positions](https://careers.sparkfabrik.com/en/#open-positions)
* If you know someone who's a good fit for one of the positions, talk to them and head them to the relevant application form (mind to ask them to specify your name as a referral in the presentation letter)
* The candidate will undergo the normal [selection process](/working-at-sparkfabrik/job-interviews)
* If we actually hire the applicant and if they pass the probabtion period, you'll be rewarded a € 1K bonus

## Conditions

Participation in our Referral Bounty program happens at the following conditions:

* **You must be already working at SparkFabrik**: if you are reading this page and you are not in SparkFabrik, please know you're not eligible for this program.
* **Ask the applicant to mention you as a referral**: ideally the candidate has to name you in the presentation message or at least the first interview.
* **The applicant must be hired and pass the probation period**: rewards are only for people that will stick to us.
* **The bonus is cumulative**: it's € 1K for each person we'll hire following your referral.
* **Bonuses will be paid on a six-months schedule**: hires closed in the first-half of the year will be rewarded December of the same year. Hires closed in the second half will be rewarded June of the next year.

## Why this?

Because we think it's a win/win.

Hiring the right people is a vital process for the growth of the company.  
At SparkFabrik we think that **good relations**, **respect** and **trust** are the foundations of great **teamwork**, that itself is the foundation of our ability to deliver.

When you refer someone you know, we are basically leveraging your trust relationship and credibility. You act as a testimonial of how good working here actually is.  
This will surely help making things happen, so that's what we reward.
