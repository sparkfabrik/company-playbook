## What's a Referral Bounty Program

The Referral Bounty Program is designed to reward those who play an **active role** in building meaningful professional bridges: recommending SparkFabrik to someone they trust, while at the same time recommending that person to SparkFabrik.

If you know anyone who you think is a good fit for a role we are searching for, step up!

## How This Works

* Keep an eye on our [open positions](https://careers.sparkfabrik.com/en/#open-positions)
* If you know someone who's a good fit for one of the positions, talk to them and head them to the relevant application form (mind to ask them to specify your name as a referral in the presentation letter)
* The candidate will undergo the normal [selection process](/working-at-sparkfabrik/job-interviews)
* If we hire the applicant and they meet the conditions below, you'll be rewarded with a €1K bonus

## Conditions

Participation in our Referral Bounty Program happens under the following conditions:

* **You must be already working at SparkFabrik**: if you are reading this page and you are not part of SparkFabrik, you are not eligible for this program.
* **Hiring and employer branding should not be among your main duties**: employees working in HR, Marketing, or DevRel are generally excluded from this program. Exceptions may be considered on a case-by-case basis.
* **Ask the applicant to mention you as a referral**: ideally, the candidate makes clear in the presentation message or during the first interview, that they applied upon your recommendation.
* **Referrals must be based on mutual trust**: casual mentions of open positions (e.g. at conferences or networking events) are part of everyone’s duty to promote SparkFabrik and are not eligible for a bounty.
* **There are not previous contacts**: if the applicant was in our hiring pipeline already, no bounty will be recognized.
* **Post-hiring conditions**: the bounty is paid only if all the following requirements are met:
  * the referred person successfully passes the probation period.
  * the referred person is not subject to disciplinary actions in the six months following the probation period.
  * the referred person’s first performance review confirms an adequate level of performance for the role.
* **The bonus is cumulative**: it's €1K for each person we'll hire following your referral.
* **Bonuses will be paid on a six-months schedule**: hires closed in the first half of the year will be rewarded in December of the same year. Hires closed in the second half will be rewarded in June of the following year.

## Why this?

Because we think it's a win-win.

Hiring the right people is a vital process for the growth of the company.  
At SparkFabrik we think that **good relations**, **respect** and **trust** are the foundations of great **teamwork**, which itself is the foundation of our ability to deliver.

When you refer someone you know, we are leveraging your trust relationship and credibility. You act as a testimonial of how good working here actually is.  
This will surely help make things happen, so that's what we reward.
