Our one-to-one meeting is heavily inspired in spirit and practice by the [24 questions to ask in your next 1:1 meeting](https://www.small-improvements.com/blog/24-questions-ask-next-11-meeting/) post by Jason Lauritsen on the _Small improvements_ blog.

HR representatives and team leads engaging in one-to-ones with developers are required to read the whole post and take inspiration.

## Cadence

The time is always right for a one-to-one, should the need arise. Anyone who wants to have a conversation with HR or the company management, be it on a specific topic or to share general feedback, can ask for one from HR.

As a rule of thumb, the company will make sure that every employee has at least two one-to-one meetings each year. All employees with a role in operations will attend the meeting with a designated HR representative.  
There are no prerequisites for one-to-ones, and an effective agenda for the meeting is detailed below, but each employee who wants to take the most out of the event must come prepared with topics to discuss.

The one-to-one is a great opportunity to talk about your career, your performance and your professional goals. If you feel this is important, we strongly advise you [get ready for the meeting with a self-assessment](/working-at-sparkfabrik/impact-assessment).  
Optionally you can ask for an assessment from your responsible or senior teammate - this is especially recommended for junior developers.

## Goal

The one-to-one meeting is **not** an occasion for control or top-down education. It is a meeting **of the employee and for the employee**, with the following goals:

* Receive honest feedback
* Provide honest feedback
* Discuss impediments
* Setting short-term goals and checking the former ones

## Agenda

To achieve meeting goals we set the following agenda over a 60 minutes meeting:

1. **Warm-up** (5 mins): What is the single most important thing we need to discuss today? (Adjust the agenda accordingly, if there is a main topic)
2. **Celebration** (10 mins): What are your most significant accomplishments since we last met? Did you already match the goals you set last time?
3. **Impediments** (15 mins): What obstacles are you encountering right now? Where do you struggle?
4. **Next goals** (15 mins): What are the most important things you will focus on before we meet next (relates to point 1)? Can we state it as a [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goal?
5. **Offer to help** (10 mins): What can we as your managers do better or differently to support you?
6. **Facilitator feedback** (5 mins): What are your feelings on this one-to-one? How should I improve as a facilitator?

## Outcome

The HR representative will summarize the outcome and new goals in a private mail with the employee, if relevant.  
The outcome of the meeting will be shared by a discussion with the company governance, and potentially team leads if applicable.
