## Salary calculator

Wages are calculated starting from baseline salary brackets, sized by role.
On top of them we add:

* lenght of service increments
* job interview scoring adjustments (determined only at hiring)
* impact scoring adjustments

## Baseline salary brackets

Here are the baseline brackets by role:

| Role | Baseline salary (€) |
|---|---|
| Junior developer | 25K |
| Senior developer | 30K |
| Lead developer | 35K |
| Professional | 40K |
| Executive | 55K |

## Length of service increments

When your length of service exceed the following milestones your wage will automatically increase as listed:

| Years of service | Salary increase (€) |
|---|---|
| 3 | 700 |
| 5 | 1.120 |
| 7 | 1.680 |
| 10 | 2.800 |

## Job interview scoring adjustments

During your job interview we will try to assess your profinciency and skills level so we can decide where you are placed on the ladder.
Depending on your expectations, the interviewer perception and the overall [job interview score](/working-at-sparkfabrik/job-interviews) you can be assigned an adjustment of up to +/-10% of the baseline salary.

A negative adjustment signals something is not desirable to us but we can decide to take a chance on you if we recognize key aspects of your personality that can fill the gap in the very first period of your career.  
In this case we will have to set clear goals and operate so that:

1. your impact score is decent at the first check (@TODO quantify!)
2. your impact score raise within 3 months of employment

A reward mean that we recognize good qualities in you for the role you are applying for or that we allow you to accept a challenge despite your request is higher than what we offer out of the box.  
In this case you will have to meet higher expectations:

1. your first impact review must score at least X points (@TODO quantify)
2.
