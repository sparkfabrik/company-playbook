### Get late?

We usually work between 9:30 to 18:30 at our offices as well as remotely.

We are not militarized with enter and leave time, as long as you are on time for your standup/daily scrum, and you keep your schedule.  
Oh, and we love to work in team so please, ensure at least 6/7 hours of team presence.

If you need to get **really** late (i.e. if this have an impact on your scheduled duties or on the agenda of your colleagues), please inform us writing at <admin@sparkfabrik.com>.  
You can surely use other channels **as long as you don't miss to write to that address!**

### Leave early?

Same rules above applies on leaving early.  
Please, be assured with your mates and team leaders that your absence won't impact the team (it usually doesn't if you can arrange things in anticipation).  

Again: even if everybody knows about your early leaving, please write to <admin@sparkfabrik.com> so we have a clear track available for everybody's leaves. This will help our administration with monthly report, among other things.

### Eat lunch at my desk or in the meeting room?

In general the preferred choice is to use the appropriate spaces at the break area or in the kitchen, but usually yes: you can **as long as you leave the space clean and tidy after lunch.**  
Useless to say that you can't do this if the meeting room is occupied. **If customers or guests are in the office, please ask for permission to a management representative.**

### Take my bicycle into office rooms?

Only in special case and when authorized by the management. 

### Take my pet in the office?

Nope. We all love animals (really, we do!) but animals have necessities that goes beyond what our office can (and want to) provide. Of course you can make your pet visit the offices occasionally, as you do with any of your friends, but you can't take your pet with you during normal working time.

If you plan to take your pet for a visit, please ask the management for permission and be sure nobody is discomfortable with it!

### Having friends visiting during office hours or for lunch?

We always welcome everybody, so yes you can!  
It would be great to inform the management of the event, just to be sure the time is appropriate. If you friend comes during working hours, please avoid the early morning when standups take place, and be sure the visit is quiet and won't impact your schedule. If you want to chat a bit, use the break area or meeting room so people in the operative room can stay _in the zone_.

### Having personal packages shipped to/from the office?

Yes, no problem! As long as it is legal (LOL), we'll take them for you if you are not at your desk. 
Yet, as we don't provide _shipment pick-up as a service_, we can't guarantee somebody will be there to take your stuff over.
