We love Agile and are committed to continuous improvement in our work practices. We have created a set of **working methods** that serve as practical frameworks and strategies for effective team collaboration and software delivery at Sparkfabrik.

These methods are meant to help teams organize their work, plan efficiently, and collaborate smoothly, ensuring that we deliver high-quality software while having time for learning and innovation and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

We believe that no single method works for all teams, so we encourage teams to customize these methods to fit their specific needs and contexts. The aim is to provide a structured yet adaptable approach that boosts productivity and team dynamics.

We also understand that working methods are not fixed; they evolve as teams grow and face new challenges. Therefore, we encourage continuous reflection on practices and making adjustments as necessary. Everyone is invited to contribute to the evolution of these methods, sharing experiences and improvements that can benefit the entire organization.
