We love Agile and are committed to continuous improvement in our work practices. We have created a set of **working methods** that serve as practical frameworks and strategies for effective team collaboration and software delivery at Sparkfabrik.

These methods are meant to help teams organize their work, plan efficiently, and collaborate smoothly, ensuring that we deliver high-quality software while having time for learning and innovation and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

We believe that no single method works for all teams, so we encourage teams to customize these methods to fit their specific needs and contexts. The aim is to provide a structured yet adaptable approach that boosts productivity and team dynamics.

We also understand that working methods are not fixed; they evolve as teams grow and face new challenges. Therefore, we encourage continuous reflection on practices and making adjustments as necessary. Everyone is invited to contribute to the evolution of these methods, sharing experiences and improvements that can benefit the entire organization.

Books we recommend for further reading on working methods include:

- **"Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time"** by Jeff Sutherland
- **"Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business"** by David J. Anderson
- **"Agile Estimating and Planning"** by Mike Cohn
- **"Agile Retrospectives: Making Good Teams Great"** by Esther Derby and Diana Larsen
- **"The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win"** by Gene Kim, Kevin Berger, and George Spafford
- **"Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow"** by Matthew Skelton, Manuel Pais, and Ruth Malan

For those in the need to learn and understand the basics that shaped our working methods, we strongly encourage the reading of the following quick primers, both freely accessible:

* [The Official Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)
* [Essential Kanban Condensed](https://kanbanbooks.com/essential-kanban-condensed/)

These are written to give you all the basics and fundamental concepts so you don't get lost during team discussions.

## Available Working Methods

- **[Sprint Framework](sprint-framework.md)** - Work organization model for development teams

## When this method does not apply

This method is intended for projects where Sparkfabrik has the authority to propose and operate the team organisation, toolchain and delivery practices. It does not apply when the project is managed and represented outside of Sparkfabrik; for example, when the customer or another third party has contractual authority to impose their own organisation, tools, ceremonies or knowledge base. In those situations our role is to deliver value within the constraints of the external setup while protecting product quality and the wellbeing of the team.

### What still applies

**Quality expectations and procedural safeguards**. Regardless of who runs the project, we continue to adhere to our quality provisions: clear acceptance criteria, rigorous testing (automated and manual where required), security and accessibility considerations, traceable decisions, and the use of defined review and release procedures where technically possible. These are non-negotiable aspects of our delivery and should be maintained or integrated with the customer's practices.

Take our [Universal Definition of Done](/tools-and-policies/universal-dod)

### What typically does not apply

Specific internal procedures, prescribed tools, labeling conventions, cadence and run-books, and mandatory ceremonies or iteration duration that are controlled by the third party. When a client platform enforces different tooling or a different rhythm, we must adapt operationally while keeping quality commitments.

### How to approach when our methods do not apply

The team leader must verify how much of the external toolchain and organisation is coherent with our way of working by asking:

- Can we use our preferred tools, or does the client provide equivalent tools with comparable capabilities?
- Is the platform, services and integrations provided by the client fit for purpose and able to meet our quality and delivery requirements?
- Are there constraints that could hinder technical quality, team productivity, or the team’s quality of life? Examples: restricted CI, missing code‑review hooks, no feature‑flagging, or poor issue‑tracking semantics.
- What mitigation strategies can we apply if problems arise? Examples: additional automated tests, temporary scripts or automation, documented workarounds, or defined escalation paths.
- Can we create opportunities to introduce our practices gradually (small, timeboxed experiments or pilots — for example via a retrospective or a spike) to demonstrate value and win buy‑in?

The last point is particularly important, being where SparkFabrik usually makes the difference.  
If the third party lacks organisation or a proper methodology, propose our solutions respectfully: suggest small experiments, demonstrate value on a short timebox, nudge the introduction of best practices, and recommend improvements to the proper decision-makers. Introducing changes via evidence-based pilots (for example in a retrospective or as a spike) is the best path to create a strong bond, contribute constructive value, and spread practices that improve quality. It can also open opportunities to upsell our expertise.

This is intended as guidance, not a strict policy. When in doubt, raise the situation early with your Delivery Manager or a board representative engaged with the client so we can align risk, expectations and any contractual implications.
