This is a checklist and flight-plan for new employees onboarding.

The document provides both _procedural_ tasks (such as opening accounts) and a depiction of the processes and assets that can help the decision making phase of an onboarding: assigning the employee to a team, mentoring her, setting goals and evaluate results.

## Requirements

The following steps give access to all confidential information in the company, so before proceeding, check that:

1. The person hiring legally started (from the present day) **OR**
2. There is a _non disclosure agreement_ running between the parties

## Devices, tools and objects

* A laptop PC must be ordered **in advance** so that it will be available on the first day of work
* For resident employees, coming to the office on a daily basis, a the office keys must be provided ideally from the first day
* Named business cards will usually be ordered after the end of the contractual trial period
* We usually provide a branded backpack with the laptop and branded stickers for the screen lid

## Pre-flight checks

An HR or Admin representative will perform the following actions:

* Open a `@sparkfabrik.com` account
* Add the newly created account to `staff@sparkfabrik.com` group
* Add the account to company's OpenVPN firewall (for external access)
* Open the Gitlab account and add it to all relevant projects
* Open the Toggl account and make sure it can access all relevant projects
* Add the account to Slack and _invite_ it on `#general` and `#tech` as well as on all channels related to relevant projects

## Things to do on the first day

### For the company

* HR must introduce the new employee to the resident team and, on slack `#general` channel, to the remote colleagues

  * Relevant starting training resources (accounts on _drupalize.me_ or _Udemy_, books or playbook pages)
  * How to contribute to the projects (branching model, peer review, etc)
  * Required tools, procedures and practices one need to know from the very beginning
* Tech and/or buddy must explain our key internal projects and self-made tools (sparkdrupal, sparkangular, sparkboard, firestarter, etc) to the employee

### For the employee

What follows will be performed with the help of your buddy, if needed

* Access all the services and check you can interact with them
* Activate two-factor auth on Gitlab
* Add SSH keys on Gitlab so you can clone the repositories
* Set your profile pictures (starting with Gravatar and checking on Gitlab, Slack, Toggl, etc) with an appropriate/decent close-up (or use the [facewall shot](#facewall-shot))
* Set your e-mail signature in [the format](#Standard-mail-signature-format) below (respect bolds)

## Things to do within the first week

* HR and the employee will schedule a brief talk where the employee will self-introduce to the company
* <a name="facewall-shot"></a>HR will arrange a shooting session for the website facewall (this can also be used as a profile picture)

## Things to do one month after the onboarding
