We require all our employees and contributors to endorse our [Company Manifesto](http://www.sparkfabrik.com/en/manifesto.html).

Sharing our values is a great indicator you can work with us, so please, take a look at them before applying for hire.
The Manifesto is a living document, so it is bound to change, moving along with our collective values. This won't happen frequently but will do from time to time.

Everybody is called to give life and form to our values.
