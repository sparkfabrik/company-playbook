Managers make things work. They coach, measure, plan ahead, warn and ultimately support people to give their best, removing obstacles, and improving their processes and procedures. In SparkFabrik people are never managed -- work is. So managers govern but never rule.

The Project Manager maintains an overview of the project's progress, ensuring that the roadmap is understood, followed, and evolved in collaboration with the Client, when new information arises during the project's execution.

They interact with the team as a coach and facilitator, by feat of their high-level perspective, working to eliminate impediments that could slow down productive processes or grind them to a halt. During crisis, if requested by the board or the team, they may need to enforce corrective actions, taking control of the project, taking an assertive stance, until ideal working conditions are restored.

The Project Manager is responsible for managing progress, budgets, and other key indicators, reporting any program deviations to the board and the client, and maintaining an analytical eye on processes to suggest corrective actions and improvements. In particular, the PM monitors the team to address any discrepancies from contractual obligations, whether they are shortfalls or overages, and realigns the team as necessary.
