- [ ] **I deliver what's expected**
- [ ] **I exceed this expectation** _(Why? Take notes!)_

</span>

#### Fluidity

You do your best to facilitate administrative and organizational processes. You build bridges across the whole company and work hard to highlight and remove wastes and obstacles as you identify them. You listen to what happens at all levels and help both management and the workforce find a common ground when you feel they lack the proper alignment.

#### Proactivity

You know when to take promptly decisions, even on partial data, or require management validation. You perceive the impacts your choices will have on the company and make sure you always work to fulfill the current strategy. You face challenges proactively, not waiting for others to solve problems for you. You handle chaotic situations without losing your mind and help others make sense of them.

#### Teamwork

You share your goals with the management and work with them. You also explain your needs or decisions to the workforce so that they'll be on the same page and understand the real value you want to be delivered. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubbornness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.
