Team Leaders excel at enabling teams, coordinating efforts, and ensuring project milestones are met. Focused on the outcomes, they drive, motivate, and keep the team committed to the project success. They ask hard questions, suggests alternative paths and apply a good deal of common sense to risk management.

They are responsible for the overall coordination of the teams, for directing the planning of single iterations so that they meet project milestones, for adhering to estimates, as well as for team motivation and morale, especially when they tend toward isolation.

They define the recurring events in the production flow (planning, review, retrospectives) in agreement with the [Project Managers](/resources/projectroles-acc-project-manager) and are accountable for implementing corrective actions identified during the retrospective phase.

They ensure that the technical project documentation is kept complete and relevant, even taking direct action in its preparation when required.
