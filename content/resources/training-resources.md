SparkFabrik offers access to a set of training resources.

Some of them are _self service_ and can be accessed by every employee as they see fit. Some others are licences on a per-seat basis and requires the creation of a personal account and relative license.

### Development

#### Udemy

We have a Udemy account we use to buy development courses that may be necessary to improve our skills or build them from zero.  
Mainly you can find training on frameworks and technologies (also Cloud technologies) of common use in SparkFabrik (Angular, React, AWS and others), but also on more specific tools.

Given the wide offering of topics on Udemy, more courses can be added in the future, even in non technical topics.

On Ultimate Courses, you can access a set of very thoroghful and deep courses on Angular by Todd Motto. Those courses are very good for who wants to deepen his understanding of Angular, get the hang of it's internals and learning how to use NgRx (a reactive state management library).
