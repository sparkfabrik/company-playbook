SparkFabrik offers access to a set of training resources.

Some of them are _self-service_ and can be accessed by every employee as they see fit. Some others are licensed on a per-seat basis and require the creation of a personal account and relative license.

This page lists all the available resources, providing a link to them and a mean to obtain access when required.

A [specific section](#core-skills-training-resources) in this page lists the educational material to be used for the acquisition of the core skills, during the onboarding period.

At the bottom of this page, in the [Filing training requests](#filing-training-requests) section, we explain how to submit requests for specific training courses/resources and keep an eye on new training resources that SparkFabrik may make available to everyone.

## Other training resources

### Development

#### Udemy

We have a Udemy account we use to buy development courses that may be necessary to improve our skills or build them from zero.
Mainly you can find training on frameworks and technologies (also Cloud technologies) of common use in SparkFabrik (Angular, React, AWS and others), but also on more specific tools.

Given the wide offering of topics on Udemy, more courses can be added in the future, even in non-technical topics.

> 1. Make sure you are [logged into GCloud](/guides/local-development-environment-configuration#log-into-gcloud) with your SparkFabrik account.
> 2. Head to [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) login page, then obtain access credentials issuing this command into a terminal:
>
> ```bash
> gcloud secrets versions access "latest" --secret credentials-udemy --project sf-public-ring
> ```

#### Ultimate Courses

On Ultimate Courses, you can access a set of very thorough and deep courses on Angular by Todd Motto. Those courses are very good for those who want to deepen their understanding of Angular, get the hang of its internals and learn how to use NgRx (a reactive state management library).
