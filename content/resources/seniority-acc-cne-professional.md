## Attitude

### Teamwork

You share your goals with your mates and work with them, never playing the hero or being a team of one. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubbornness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.

- [ ] **I deliver what's expected**
- [ ] **I exceed this expectation** _(Why? Take notes!)_

</span>

### Self-organization

Your schedule and workload balance is your responsibility. You have clear what's expected of you each iteration (week, sprint, milestone) and step up to discuss conflicting priorities and possible bottlenecks with the management.

</span>

### Lucidity

You have a clear understanding of what's expected from you and what you have to do to match the expectation. When you feel like you lost your goals, you speak up and do your best to have them clear. You understand when your junior colleagues are stuck because of this issue and, with patience, you help them get out of the _impasse_.

</span>

### Customer-orientation

You are genuinely involved in the success of each initiative and always speak with transparency, honesty, and a friendly but professional tone - because we want to deserve customers' trust. You always have a clear understanding of the customers' needs and, when something doesn't sound right, you speak up, asking honest questions, to make sure you're working towards the right goal.

### Strong opinions, lightly held

You speak your mind and sustain your ideas with words and facts, but you are open to criticism and listen with open ears.
