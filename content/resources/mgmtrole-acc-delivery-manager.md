Delivery Managers ensure the successful execution of projects by overseeing delivery processes, maintaining client relationships, and enabling operational efficiency. They act as a bridge between high-level management, project teams, and support functions, aligning business goals with technical execution.

The organizational approach of a Delivery Manager may vary depending on the area they oversee. Those managing maintenance activities may adopt _pull_ approches better suited for emergent workflows, whereas those handling project delivery may operate as project managers, utilizing milestone- or goal-driven iteration frameworks.

As part of the low-level management structure, Delivery Managers have a vertical focus on specific areas or macro-teams, ensuring that projects within their scope are well-organized, delivered with quality, and meet contractual obligations. They proactively identify risks, dependencies, and process inefficiencies, ensuring smooth workflows across different operational units. While collaborating closely with [Staff Engineers](/resources/mgmtrole-acc-staff-engineers), their focus remains on the operational dimension rather than technical decisions.

They are also responsible for periodic reporting to the board and high-level management, keeping them informed about project health, client satisfaction, and potential business opportunities.
