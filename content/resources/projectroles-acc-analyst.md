Analysts are great when it comes to mapping a domain, fathoming complexity and expressing it in a clear, rational, understandable form. Analysts may not always have a solution at hand but for sure they know when a need is fulfilled or a problem is solved. Analysts' skills make for great Product Owners.

Analysts are responsible for the functional analysis of products in progress on behalf of the customers. They define the requirements for its features and can contribute to the population of the work backlog. They are the individuals tasked with maintaining consistency between the product's functionalities and ensuring that the requirements are clear and well-described, ready to be worked on by the team.

They do not handle the technical direction of the project (thus, they do not evaluate individual implementations from a technical perspective) or the management of deadlines, budgets, and external priorities unrelated to the product.

## Caveats

The analyst must maintain continuous involvement with the client and the project, much like the [Project Manager](/resources/projectroles-acc-project-manager). They cannot be assigned on an on-call basis as they are the owner of client request analysis and need continuity and full visibility to perform effectively.

They must comprehensively analyze and manage client requests throughout the project's lifespan. This requires a sufficiently technical background to handle them independently and manage requirements even involving technical decisions, without necessarily making those decisions themselves.
