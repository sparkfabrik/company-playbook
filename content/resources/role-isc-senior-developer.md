You share your goals with your mates and work with them, never playing the hero or being a team of one. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubbornness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.

#### Impact scoring values
- **A++**: Over the top amazingness. You do, teach and lead. When people think of this skill, they think of you. Even in Sparkfabrik, where people are expected to excel, such a score will be rare. You can aim here but are not expected to, probably this reflects an aspect of your personality or a natural talent.
- **A+**: You do more than your mates expect, even considering we have demandingly high standards.
- **A**: You totally do what's expected, matching our high standards. Undeniably positive impact.
- **B**: Good performance but with improvement headroom. When you have to set your quarterly or yearly professional goal, here is where to put your energy first.
- **C**: This falls way behind our expectations and you need to improve significantly in this area. Such a score will inevitably set a goal for you for the next quarter, when this is expected to have become a B. Scoring the same C over and over is not acceptable.
- **X**: Not applicable.
