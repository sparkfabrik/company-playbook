#### Impact scoring values
- **A++**: Over the top amazingness. You do, teach and lead. When people think of this skill, they think of you. Even in Sparkfabrik, where people are expected to excel, such a score will be rare. You can aim here but are not expected to, probably this reflects an aspect of your personality or a natural talent.
- **A+**: You do more than your mates expect, even considering we have demandingly high standards.
- **A**: You totally do what's expected, matching our high standards. Undeniably positive impact.
- **B**: Good performance but with improvement headroom. When you have to set your quarterly or yearly professional goal, here is where to put your energy first.
- **C**: This falls way behind our expectations and you need to improve significantly in this area. Such a score will inevitably set a goal for you for the next quarter, when this is expected to have become a B. Scoring the same C over and over is not acceptable.
- **X**: Not applicable.
