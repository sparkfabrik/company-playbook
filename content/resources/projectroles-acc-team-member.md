Team Members are developers and designers who take in charge implementing the project's features, under the guidance of the [Team Leader](/resources/projectroles-acc-team-leader) and following what has been defined bu the [Solution Architect](/resources/projectroles-acc-architect).

## Caveats

The whole chain of decisions, and the [Project Manager](/resources/projectroles-acc-project-manager) should make every effort to ensure that the project team remains stable throughout the project's duration.  
Frequent reassignments hinder the acquisition of essential project knowledge and undermine the identification of a shared goal, which is crucial for motivating and instilling a sense of responsibility towards the project's success.

## Ownership

* Respect of their own commitment
* Making the software work on all target environments
* Compliance with the Solution Architect's instructions

## Practical tasks

* Feature implementation
* Estimation of issues (with [Analysts](/resources/projectroles-acc-analyst) and/or [Solution Architects](/resources/projectroles-acc-architect))
* Population of technical To-Do lists for each issue (with [Solution Architects](/resources/projectroles-acc-architect))

## Concrete outputs

* Software compliant with functional requirements and technical instructions (including SparkFabrik's [Universal Definition of Done](/tools-and-policies/universal-dod))
