## Attitude

#### Teamwork

You share your goals with your mates and work with them, never playing the hero or being a team of one. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubbornness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.

#### Self-organization

Your schedule and workload balance is your responsibility. You have clear what's expected of you each iteration (week, sprint, milestone) and step up to discuss conflicting priorities and possible bottlenecks with the management.
