## Attitude

### Leadership

You are an organizational model for your colleagues. You live by best practices and require and help others to meet your high standards. You do your best to lead by consensus, listening to every voice, but you always remember they look at you as a guide. You identify and remove obstacles for others but keep them committed and fit to create value.

- [ ] **I still can't match the expectation** _(Why? Take notes!)_
- [ ] **I deliver what's expected**
- [ ] **I exceed this expectation** _(Why? Take notes!)_

</span>

### Decisiveness

You take prompt decisions, even on partial data, perceiving the overall impacts on people, schedules, and deliverables. You face challenges proactively, not waiting for others to solve problems for you. You handle difficult situations without losing your mind and help others endure them.

</span>

### Teamwork

You share your goals with your mates and work with them, never playing the hero or being a team of one. You speak your voice clearly, even when it's difficult, without holding relevant information for fear or stubbornness. When being frank makes you uncomfortable, you still strive to be polite and cheerful so you can make your point.

</span>

### Customer-orientation

You always have a clear understanding of the customer's needs and, when they seem confused, you help them state their needs in a clear, understandable way. You are genuinely involved in the success of the project and always speak with transparency, honesty, and a friendly but professional tone - because we want to deserve customers' trust. You keep your eyes open for unspoken needs that we can address for our customers and proactively bring them to light.

### Self-organization

Your schedule and workload balance is your responsibility. You have clear what's expected of you each iteration (week, sprint, milestone) and step up to discuss conflicting priorities and possible bottlenecks with the management.

</span>

### Lucidity

You have a clear understanding of what's expected from you and what you have to do to match the expectation. When you feel like you lost your goals, you speak up and do your best to have them clear. You understand when your junior colleagues are stuck because of this issue and, with patience, you help them get out of the _impasse_.

### Strong opinions, lightly held

You speak your mind and sustain your ideas with words and facts, but you are open to criticism and listen with open ears.
