This page lists a set of official resources that anyone in SparkFabrik may use for communication and promotion.

Those assets must be preferred to any other variant, so always make use of these templates and media, unless you have a very good reason not to.

## Presentation templates

Since we have different OSes on our company's hardware, we rely on Google Suite for company documents editing.  
When you need to create a new presentation, refrain to use local/proprietary solutions and stick with what we chosed.

For slides sets, we created two layouts, one with a **light** background and one with a **dark** one.

Access Drive with your company account allows you to create a new presentation from one of the availabe templates (`Drive -> New -> Presentation -> From template` and choose the `Sparkfabrik GmbH` tab at the top).

Instructions on how to make the best out of those layouts are in the first page of each template.
