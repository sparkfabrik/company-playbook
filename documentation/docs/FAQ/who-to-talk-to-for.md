### Time off

First of all, talk to your Team Leader to understand if having you of is sustainable.
If you are the Team Leader, please talk with your team and with one of the management board to make sure your team can go on without your direction.

Once done, send a mail to admin@sparkfabrik.com specifing your desired dates/time off and wait for a written reply to your request.  
This isn't done to carve the permission in stone, but to make sure all administrative processes involved in you having time off will be triggered.

### I'm worried about something

If it's important to you, but not urgent, please use our physical or virtual [Parking lot]. If it partains only your project, jot down a note to discuss during project retrospectives.
If it's urgent, don't hesitate to reach out for your Team Leader for porject-related issues or to talk to a person in the management board if you see fit.

### My equipment is broken/mulfunctioning

Please, write immediately to admin@sparkfabrik.com if your gizmos have problems. We need to be informed quickly to enforce warranties before expiration.
If you have problem with a facility you own personally, we'll be eager to provide a temporary or permanent replacement. Again, don't hesitate to warn us about the problem, you are supposed to be able to work at the full extent.

### I can't get the reasons of a company decision

SparkFabrik claim to be open to every voice. Still in the end someone in the management board has to take final decisions. It may be that you don't get all the reasons behind a specific choice. In that case, feel free to reach out for someone in the management board (target specific persons if you are sure to know who took that decision) and ask for clarifications.

We really want everyone to be on board and it's important that everybody who has an interest in understanding the company direction can get explanations about it.

### I have a problem with a colleague / someone in here

First of all, try to solve it by mean of polite, explicit discussion. Try not to be shy, touchy or too proud: our manifesto assumes that all of us work giving the best. If things don't click, admit it with trasnparency and an open mind for the ideas of your counterpart.

If this won't solve, you can talk with your team leader or a management board representative. Mind that odds are good that your mate will arrange a meeting with the person your are in trouble with, to help both of you analysing things from an impartial position.

We can't promise all will be OK but we are sure that everyone will have a chance to express her voice.

### I want to propose a company-wide activity

Great! If it's something outside the working time, organized and carried out by the involved people (better yet if anyone can opt in/out at wish) but still meant to be a "company event" (a dinner, a meetup, the [Board Game Night], etc) you can use [Slack channels], propose it out loud in the office or what you want! The bottom line is that you can organize it without any prior consent.

Is you have an idea for an activity with impacts on:

* Time budgets
* Money budgets
* Requires the presence of all / the majority of the staff
* Can provide a valuable asset for the company (training sessions, presence to an event, a retreat, etc.)

then, talk about it with the management board or drop a line to admin@sparkfabrik.com. We'll evaluate it against other proposals or ideas, possibly putting them to the votes of everybody in the company, we'll make sure it stays in the budget and cohordinates the presence of every involved people. If you want to help in organization, you'll be welcome as long as your Team Leader will give an OK to spend a part of your time on the activity.

### I want to propose a variation to the company rules

This is something we'd like to discuss with everybody! Put a card in the [Parking lot] and we'll discuss it with everybody during a company retrospective. If you feel it's urgent, drop a line at admin@sparkfabrik.com and reach out for a management board representative.
